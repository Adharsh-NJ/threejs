Three.js Fundamentals

--structure of 3 js--

Scene: it includes objects,lighting and angles etc.
     Group:
     mesh:
     material:
     Geomatry:
     Texture:
Renderer: this is generating an image with passing scene and camera
Camera: how the user is watching .


--Camera and renderloop--
updateProjectionMatrix should be called when changing the camera parameters
-perspective camera :
feild of view(fov):how much should be visible in camera
aspect ratio
near 
far
-orthographic camera:


-orbitControls:
this allows as to control the objects inside and run animations within creating an orbit(rotation draging etc)
-renderloop
this updates the canvas realtime
window.requestAnimationFrame : instead of using infinte loop or timeouts ,we can update the frames as the refresh rates of the screen


what to do with stair case like edges?
we can use antialias to be true in the webglRender to avoid it 
we can set the pixelRatio to be window.devicePixelRatio max can be 2

--The mesh--

the postions is an vector 3 
there is a new vector method to set the position 
there is a set method to set all three together
there is a property in basic mesh to show the wireframe of the object wireFrame:true

group:
group can consists of different meshs and the properties applied to group will be applied to everything inside

rotations:
the unit is mentioned in radiants .eighther we can convert it to degree by muliplying with Math.pi(180 deg) or we can use Three.MathUtils.degToRad(deg)

-- material--
Non environment Reacting materials
mesh basic 
mesh matcap
mesh depth

environment Reacting materials(Graphical Accuracy)
mesh lambert          |
mesh phong            |      graphical accuracy increasing          
mesh standard         |
mesh physical         \/

there is texture that we can wrap around materials 
and uv map is to determine how it can be wrapped on to it
we can wrap different parts with different textures
there is roughness map and metalnessMaps in material
ambient inclusion map(AO map) is used to add the shadows created by the object
AO needs other uv map for to work
